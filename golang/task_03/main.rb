# Given an array of audio file durations, write a function to group the files into playlists such that each playlist's total duration does not exceed a given limit maxDuration. Return an array of playlists, where each playlist is an array of file durations. Try to minimize the number of playlists.

# Example:

# ```
# const files = [120, 90, 60, 150, 80];
# const maxDuration = 200;

# groupAudioFiles(files, maxDuration)
# > [[150], [120,80], [90,60]]

# groupAudioFiles(files, 160)
# > [[150], [120], [90,60], [80]]

# ```

func groupAudioFiles(files []uint, duration uint) [][]int {

}
