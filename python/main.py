# Youâ€™re assembling a custom mechanical keyboard. Each required part has a
# delivery time in days and an assembly time in hours. You can only assemble
# a part after it arrives, and you can only work on one part at a time.
# Given an array of parts where each part is { name, arrivalDays, assemblyHours },
# return the minimum total hours needed to finish assembling all parts,
# starting from hour 0.

# Example:

# minAssemblyTime([
#   { name: "keycaps", arrivalDays: 1, assemblyHours: 2 },
#   { name: "switches", arrivalDays: 2, assemblyHours: 3 },
#   { name: "stabilizers", arrivalDays: 0, assemblyHours: 1 },
#   { name: "PCB", arrivalDays: 1, assemblyHours: 4 },
#   { name: "case", arrivalDays: 3, assemblyHours: 2 }
# ])

# > 74
